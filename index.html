          <!--Description of first column-->
          <p1>A study from NASA has found that the global sea level has raised by about 8 inches (20.32cm) since 1880.
             It has also been proposed that by 2100, another 1 to 8 feet increase of the water level will occur, which is the result of the melted land ice coupled with the increase in seawater as it warms.

          <!--Description of the second column-->
          <p3>An article from the European Union states that one of the main factors that cause climate change is due to the increase in greenhouse gases.
             The gases that make up the greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and flourinated gases.
             The biggest percentage of the greenhouse gases is made up of carbon dioxide, which is created by human activity.
             While the others are produced by human activity as well in smaller percentages.
             It was noticed that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmostsphere has increased by 48% in 2020 compared to the pre-industrial level (before 1750).
